Bind parameters—also called dynamic parameters or bind variables—are an alternative way to pass data to the database. Instead of putting the values directly into the SQL statement, you just use a placeholder like ?, :name or @name and provide the actual values using a separate API call.
Two reasons for using bind variables are for security and performance
1. Security - they are used to prevent SQL injection
2. Performance - Databases with an execution plan cache like SQL Server and the Oracle database can reuse an execution plan when executing the same statement multiple times. 

When using bind parameters you do not write the actual values but instead insert placeholders into the SQL statement. That way the statements do not change when executing them with different values.
